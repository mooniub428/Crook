# Crook
An ecommerce-takeaway project that is consisted of two android apps, one for the customers and one for the employees. A customer can update his cart by adding or removing products from it, and by sending periodically his location to the server, store's employees can be notified when he is close so they can gather the products of his order and deliver them faster to the customer (like takeaway). Of course, employees are able to add, remove or update products by using their app. The CRUDS that are related with these operations as well with some others customers' operations, are handled by a REST api written in PHP and MySQLi.
